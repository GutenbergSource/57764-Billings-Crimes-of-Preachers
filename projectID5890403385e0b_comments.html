<HTML><BODY>This appalling list of criminal behavior by preachers serves well to drill down the point that preachers are also human beings, and that there is no need to place them on a pedestal by their (often self-assumed) title alone.

<p>Note that several of the transgressions listed wouldn't be considered crimes in today's context (extra-marital sexual affairs, homosexuality, etc.), although it doesn't hurt pointing out the hypocrisy of setting high standards for others, then breaking them for yourself.

<p>The book contains one large multi-page table in five columns, printed sideways. I've rotated the pages to accommodate this. During the Formatting rounds, please don't try to format the table as a table; Instead, use the following markup scheme:

<p>For each table row, put each field (cell of the table) on a new line prefixed by a one-letter code to indicate what is
in the line.

<pre>
Y: Date (mostly Year, so Y)
N: Preacher's Name
R: Residence
D: Church (D is for Denomination)
C: Crime Charged (Since these are longer
lines, they can continue on the next line)
</pre>

<p>then have a blank line for the next row. Fields that are empty can simply be omitted, so no need to have a line with just a code.

<p>Some lines have braces, especially in the Residence field, please format these as follows with a pipe-symbol:

<pre>
R: Residence 1 | Residence 2 | Residence 3 | etc.
</pre>

<p>Ditto marks can be handled like this:

<pre>
R: Town, State | Town, " | Town, "
</pre>

<p>Please indicate other uses of braces with a small [**note:]

<p>There is also no need to repeat the running header of the table.

<p>I will restore the table layout during PP using some scripts.
